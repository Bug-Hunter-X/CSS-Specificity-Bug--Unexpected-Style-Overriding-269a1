The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.my-class {
  color: red;
}

#my-id {
  color: green;
}

div.my-class#my-id {
  color: purple; /* This selector will override others due to high specificity */
}
```

In this example, the `div.my-class#my-id` selector is highly specific.  It targets an element that is simultaneously a `div`, has the class `my-class`, and the ID `my-id`. Because of this high specificity, it overrides the rules set for `div`, `.my-class`, and `#my-id`.

This can become a bug if the developer is unaware of the order of specificity and expects a different color to be applied.
