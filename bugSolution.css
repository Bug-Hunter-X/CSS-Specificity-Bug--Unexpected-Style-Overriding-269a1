To solve the specificity issue, we can refactor the CSS to avoid conflicting selectors or to use the !important flag judiciously.  Here's one solution:

```css
/* Solution: Using more specific selectors to ensure intended styles are applied */
div {
  color: blue;
}

.my-class {
  color: red;
}

#my-id {
  color: green;
}

/* The high specificity selector is removed or refactored to use the intended styles. */
#my-id.my-class {
  color: purple; /* More specific if this is what you want. */
}
/* or if you wish to override with important flag use this */
#my-id {
  color: green !important; /* Use !important only when absolutely necessary. */
}
```

The solution ensures the styles are applied as intended, either by using appropriate specificity rules or the !important flag when truly needed (with caution!).
